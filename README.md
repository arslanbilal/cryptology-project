<h3>This repo includes "Cryptology Course" project(Encrypted Messaging App in iOS 8.0+)</h3>
<hr>

## Summary:
Simple iOS messaging application and working in locale [database][realm]. Messages are protected with AES Symmetric Encryption. Only messages owners can see their messages in the plain text format. Otherwise messages are encrypted. Man-in-the-Middle never see plain text. Password doesn't hold in DB. Password salt and hash are fields of user table in DB. Message keys can change from users.

#### Specifications:
	- User can login
	- User can message other users
	- User see only own messages
	- User message is in a place(incoming, outgoing)
	- Messages are encrypting with AES 256 bit key.
	- User can only see his/her own messages, others are encrypted.
	- Man-in-the-Middle see for all Cipher Message.
	- Man-in-the-Middle does not have key to see plain format.
	- Login with Captcha approval.
	- Account screen for change password, key and sign out.
	- User login is postponed for 30 min; after 3 wrong login attempt.
	- User account is locked; after 5 wrong login attempt.
	- User password can not known. Password Salt and Hast hold in DB.
	- User can change password. (min 8 chac.)
	- User can change message key. (generating new key)

You can run in your own machine. You just uncomment the `genenaretUsersWithCount(Int)` method in AppDelegate.swift file for adding random user in the system. Then recomment the same line. To test:

1. username: user# (no is depends on count that you assign the func.)
2. password: 1234

## Requirement:
- iOS 8.0+
- Swift version 2.2 (swiftlang-703.0.18.1 clang-703.0.29)
- Xcode 7.3+

## Architecture:
There are 4 classes that represent 4 tables in the Realm database.

- User: (*(int)* **id**, *(string)* **name**, *(string)* **lastname**, *(string)* **username**, *(string)* **passwordSalt**, *(string)* **passwordHash**, *(bool)* **isLocked**, *(int)* **wrongAttemptCount**, *(Date)* **attemptableDate**)
- Message: (*(int)* **id**, *(string)* **text**, *(Date)* **date**)
- Key: (*(int)* **id**, *(string)* key)
- Chat: (*(Message)* **message**, *(User)* **fromUser**, *(User)* **toUser**, *(Key)* **key**)

User, Message and Key are have a relation with Chat. Table(Class) Relations:

- Chat - Message: one-to-one
- Chat - User: many-to-many
- Chat - Key: one to many

## Technologies/Libraries/Frameworks that used:
**Frameworks:**

- [Realm][realm] database is used for backend.

**Dependencies/Libraries**

- [PureLayout][purelayout] for UI Autolayout
- [FBEncryptor][fbencryptor] 
	- Encrypt/Decrypt messages with chat specific key
	- Pasword Salting.
